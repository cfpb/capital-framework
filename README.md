# cf-demo

cf-demo is the recommended workflow for using Capital Framework components.
It is also a sample front-end project.
[Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) are used to pull
component source files in to sample project Less and JS files and for compiling
these files into a [sample page](https://cfpb.github.io/cf-demo/).

If you're new to Capital Framework, we encourage you to
