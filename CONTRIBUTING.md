There are two primary ways to help:
 - Using the issue tracker, and
 - Changing the code-base.


## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in
the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the codebase_
guidance below.


## Changing the codebase

We are no longer forking and pulling. Instead, we are working off feature branches.
After you've edited a component, open a PR to merge your feature branch back into `master`.

For example, if you wanted to change `cf-buttons`, here's what you'd do:

1. `git clone git@github.com:cfpb/capital-framework.git`
1. `cd capital-framework`
1. `yarn` to install dependencies and set up [workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/)
1. `git checkout -b button-fix` to create a new branch for your changes.
1. Edit file(s) in `/packages/cf-buttons/` however you want.
1. `yarn run cf-link` to [link](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/) your local CF components.
1. `cd ~/wherever/cfgov-refresh/` to navigate to another project where you'd like to test your buttons changes (in this case, cfgov-refresh).
1. `yarn link cf-buttons` to link cf-buttons to cfgov-refresh.
1. `gulp build` in cfgov-refresh to compile your stylesheets.
1. [Start cfgov-refresh](https://cfpb.github.io/cfgov-refresh/usage/) and navigate to a page with buttons to view your cf-buttons changes.
1. When you're pleased with your changes, `cd` back to your `capital-framework` repo and commit your changes: `git commit -am "Fix button border radius"`
1. `git push origin button-fix` to push your branch up to GitHub.
1. Go to https://github.com/cfpb/capital-framework and open a pull request to merge `button-fix` into `master`.

If you are not a current contributor to Capital Framework, continue using forks
by first clicking the fork button on top of the repository and cloning your fork in step 1. In the final step, go to https://github.com/cfpb/capital-framework and file a pull request by clicking the link to compare changes across forks.

### Testing components locally

#### Automated tests

Automated tests can be run with the command `yarn test`.

#### Testing in the documentation site

If you're hacking on a component and want to test it in the documentation site follow the following steps.

In this repo:
- Check out a working branch
- Run `yarn run cf-link`

In a second local clone of this repo in a different folder:

- Make sure you're on the gh-pages branch
- [Run all the install steps for the project](https://github.com/cfpb/capital-framework/tree/gh-pages#installation)
- Run `npm run cf-link` (the gh-pages branch still uses npm, we will eventually move it to yarn)
- Run `npm start`
- Open a browser at http://localhost:3000/ and navigate to the component you've changed
- When you've finished testing run `npm run cf-unlink` to reset your components to the published releases


### Browser support

We configure [Autoprefixer](#autoprefixer) and [Babel](#babel) to support the following list of browsers.

- Latest 2 releases of all browsers including:
    - Chrome
    - Firefox
    - Safari
    - Internet Explorer
    - Edge
    - Opera
    - iOS Safari
    - Opera Mini
    - Android Browser
    - BlackBerry Browser
    - Opera Mobile
    - Chrome for Android
    - Firefox for Android
    - Samsung Internet
- Internet Explorer 9

http://browserl.ist/?q=last+2+versions%2C+Explorer+%3E%3D+9

As well as additional Autoprefixer support for:

- Internet Explorer 8

http://browserl.ist/?q=last+2+versions%2C+Explorer+%3E%3D+8

What this means to the end-user is we've added a level of backward
compatability for modern features as much as possible. This doesn't
necessarily mean feature parity. Where it's impossible or impractical to
implement a modern feature, we fallback to standard practices for that browser.
For example, we do not deliver interactive scripting for Internet Explorer 8,
but we do ensure that default browser features continue to work so users
that can't or don't want to upgrade continue to have access to the site and
our content.

#### Browser Testing

We have automated tests that use a headless version of Chrome to ensure
the majority of the site is working as expected. For manual testing, we
realistically test this project locally or in a virtual environment with the
following list of browsers:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10, and 11
- Edge
- iOS Safari
- Chrome for Android

#### Autoprefixer

Autoprefixer parses our CSS and adds vendor prefixes to rules where necessary
using reported feature support by [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/). For more
information visit the [Autoprefixer documentation site]
(https://autoprefixer.github.io/).

#### Babel

Babel compiles our [ES6](http://es6-features.org/) JavaScript where necessary
for the browsers that either don't support or have limited support of ES6
features. For more information visit the [Babel documentation site]
(https://babeljs.io/).

#### Known feature differences

- JavaScript: We do not serve interactive scripting to IE 8 but we do deliver
  analytics via JavaScript.
- Icons: We currently use icon fonts to deliver scalable icons. Browsers that
  do not support icon fonts unfortunately do not receive backups but we try to
  always pair icons with text.

#### Notes

The CSS and JavaScript files that are generated during the build task are only
used for testing. Because this project doesn't necessarily produce a final
product it is up to the projects that use it to generate and maintain their own
browser support config. An example of this is
[consumerfinance.gov](https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh), which generates
specific IE 8 and 9 stylesheets, whereas the Capital Framework build task
bundles those with the main stylesheet. Despite the differences in delivery,
the output and support are the same.

### Updating Documentation

Documentation is maintained in each component's folder's `usage.md` file.
Changes to documentation are made on the `master` branch using the workflow above
and pulled in the `gh-pages` branch using a manual process detailed below.
The `usage.md` files are then rendered as separated pages on Capital Framework's website
[(See this example from cf-core)](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/components/cf-core/).

After a release with documentation changes, you can checkout the `gh-pages` branch,
and `yarn add` any new dependencies in Capital Framework.
After installing your new dependencies run `yarn run build` to build the documentation site.

Run `yarn start` to check your work and push it up to a new branch to merge into `gh-pages`.

```sh
git checkout gh-pages
git pull
yarn
git checkout -b gh-pages-updates
git push origin gh-pages-updates
```

Once you've completed these steps, file a pull request against `gh-pages`.


## Release management

Ready to publish changes to npm?
Ensure you're on `master` and `git pull` to confirm you're up-to-date.
Then run `yarn run release`.
Lerna will update the changelog, ask for a new version number, create a git tag,
push to GitHub and publish to npm.

If you'd like to preview the changelog before publishing anything,
run `yarn run changelog` and open `CHANGELOG.md`.
