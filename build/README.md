## How to get this running or how to use it

Detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and get the project running.
This should be frequently tested to ensure reliability. Alternatively, a link to
another page is fine, but it's important that this works.


## Getting involved

currently focusing on; e.g., trying to get feedback on features, fixing certain bugs, building
important pieces, etc.
