Capital Framework is a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript patterns
by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with the following goals:
consolidate front-end code patterns across CFPB web products
in a collaborative way, adhere to design and UX standards set forth
by the CFPB Design Manual, respect the guiding principles of accessibility,
and support a wide range of browsers.

As a work of the United States government, all code is open source and
in the public domain (excluding any exceptions listed within in the project's
[`TERMS.md` file](https://github.com/cfpb/capital-framework/blob/master/TERMS.md#exceptions)).
We encourage you to use this framework in your own projects
and to contribute back.

## Browser support & testing

We actively test Capital Framework components in the following browsers:

- Chrome
- Firefox

- Edge
- IE 8+

### Accessibility

We deeply value accessible web products and work to ensure that all of
our components comply with [Section 508](https://section508.gov/) rules for
[creating accessible software and websites](https://www.section508.gov/create/software-websites).
We actively test components to ensure that they are
keyboard and screen reader friendly.
