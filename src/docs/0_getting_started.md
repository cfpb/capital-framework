# Getting started

Capital Framework provides a set of modular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript patterns that can be used both collectively and individually.
There are several ways to integrate Capital Framework into your project:

1. [Using the generator](#using-the-generator)
1. [Using Less](#using-less)
1. [Downloading the compiled CSS](#downloading-the-compiled-css)

Our recommended workflow is to use the generator to scaffold out a new Capital Framework project.
This allows you to pick and choose your modules as well as providing a solid front end build process.

## Using the generator

To use the generator, you will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

### Installing dependencies

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) can be downloaded and installed directly from the Node website, or by using a package manager for your system. At the CFPB we use Homebrew. To install the dependencies:

```bash
$ brew install node # If installing node with homebrew
$ npm install --global grunt-cli gulp yo generator-cf
```

### Scaffolding out a project

To create a new project, create a directory, cd into that directory, and run the `yo cf` command:

```bash
$ mkdir my-awesome-projet
$ cd my-awesome-project
$ yo cf
```

The generator will prompt you to complete information about the project and choose the Capital Framework modules you would like to use.

### Navigating the project folder

Once the generator has finished you'll have a folder full of files and folders.
Here's a quick guide on working with these files:

- Run `npm run build` to process the files in `src` and output them to `dist`.
- To view your site, go to the dist directory and start a local server: `cd dist && python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. You can now navigate to `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
- Edit files within the `src` directory and re-run `npm run build` to view changes.

#### Editing the Less and JS

The generator has created a starter Less file at `src/static/css/main.less`.
This file includes all of the necessary imports needed for Capital Framework.
There is also a starter JavaScript file at `src/static/js/main.js`.
Both `main.less` and `main.js` are already wired into `Gruntfile.js` (or `gulp/tasks/`
if you selected gulp) so compiling is as easy as running `npm run build`. It also
copies files from `src` into `dist`, which will update what you see at `localhost:8000/`.

### Theming / Customizing

You can override component UI colors within `src/static/css/cf-theme-overrides.less`.
This is already set up for you and gets imported by `main.less`.
If you would like to use your own color palette simply replace the contents of
`brand-palette.less` with your own color variables,
then update `cf-theme-overrides.less` by overriding each UI color variable
with a color from `brand-palette.less` or any color of your choosing.

The same applies when you need to add custom styles to your project.
You can add any custom `.less` files to your project that you may need,
just remember to import them in `main.less` using the correct path.

## Using Less

If you don't want to use the generator,
you can just download the source files and import them into your project.

**NOTE: Be sure to run the Less files through
  [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer),
  or your compiled Capital Framework CSS will
  not work perfectly in older browsers.**

Run `npm install capital-framework`. This will download Capital Framework to your
project's `node_modules` directory. You can then import the framework into
your application's primary Less file:

```css
@import (less) "node_modules/capital-framework/src/capital-framework.less";

// the rest of your stylesheet...
```

Just want one or two CF components and not the entire framework?
Simply install and `@import` only the components you need.

```sh
$ npm install cf-buttons cf-icons
```

```css
@import (less) "node_modules/cf-buttons/src/cf-buttons.less";
@import (less) "node_modules/cf-icons/src/cf-icons.less";

// the rest of your stylesheet...
```

## Downloading the compiled CSS

Capital Framework's compiled CSS can be <a class="cf-download" href="https://npmcdn.com/capital-framework/dist/">downloaded here</a>.
Download it and copy the files found in the `dist/` directory to your project.
Use standard `<link>` and `<script>` tags.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Awesome Project</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="capital-framework.min.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your project's HTML goes here. -->
    <script src="capital-framework.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
