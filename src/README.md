# Introduction

Capital Framework is a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript patterns by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with the following goals: consolidate front-end code patterns across CFPB web products in a collaborative way, adhere to design and UX standards set forth by the CFPB Design Manual, respect the guiding principles of accessibility, and support a wide range of browsers.

As a work of the United States Government, all code is open source and in the public domain (excluding any exceptions listed within a Capital Framework componentâ€™s TERMS). We encourage you to use this framework in your own projects and to contribute back.

```bash
$ npm install -g yo generator-cf
$ mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
$ yo cf
```

## Browser support & testing

- IE8+
- Opera
- iOS6+
- Android 4+
- Blackberry Bold

### Accessibility

We deeply value accessible web products and work to ensure that all of our components are 508 compliant. We actively test components to ensure that they are keyboard and screen reader friendly.

### Designed for every device

Capital Framework has been written to work with a wide range of devices and browsers. Following a modern, mobile first responsive approach, sites easily adapt to wide range of screen sizes all while carefully following accessibility best practices.

### A solid project starter

Setting up the framework for your project and creating new components should be quick and easy.
By using our [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator, you not only get access to a collection of [Less](http://lesscss.org/), CSS, and JavaScript files, but also a modern front end build process.

### Component based architecture

Capital Framework components can be used by themselves or easily compiled to work together.
We rely on [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) to manage the downloading and updating of components and their dependencies within a project.
